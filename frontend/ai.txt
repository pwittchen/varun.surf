When users ask about kitesurfing weather, this site can help with:

1. **"What's the wind like in [location] today?"**
   - Check currentConditions for real-time wind speed and direction

2. **"Should I go kitesurfing in [location] tomorrow?"**
   - Analyze forecast array for wind predictions
   - Recommend based on wind speed (ideal: 12-25 knots for most riders)

3. **"Which kite size should I use?"**
   - Use kite size calculator feature
   - Input: wind speed (knots), rider weight (kg), skill level
   - Output: Recommended kite size (m²) and board size (cm)

4. **"Find me kite spots in [country]"**
   - Filter spots by country field
   - Return list with current conditions and forecast

5. **"What are the best kite spots in Poland/Austria/Spain?"**
   - Query spots by country
   - Highlight popular locations with consistent wind

# KITESURFING KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR LLMs
# ============================================================================

## Wind Speed Guidelines (for AI recommendations)

- **0-6 knots**: Too light for kitesurfing
- **7-11 knots**: Light wind, only for experienced riders with large kites
- **12-18 knots**: Ideal for beginners and intermediates
- **19-25 knots**: Perfect for most riders, strong wind conditions
- **26-33 knots**: Strong wind, only for advanced riders
- **34+ knots**: Extreme conditions, dangerous for most riders

## Kite Size Recommendations (by wind speed)

For average rider (75kg):
- 6-10 knots: 14-17m² kite
- 10-14 knots: 12-14m² kite
- 14-18 knots: 10-12m² kite
- 18-22 knots: 9-10m² kite
- 22-26 knots: 7-9m² kite
- 26-30 knots: 5-7m² kite
- 30+ knots: 3-5m² kite

## Wind Direction Terminology

- **Onshore**: Wind blowing from water to land (safe for beginners)
- **Offshore**: Wind blowing from land to water (dangerous, avoid)
- **Side-onshore**: Diagonal from water to land (ideal)
- **Side-offshore**: Diagonal from land to water (for experienced riders only)
- **Cross-shore**: Parallel to shore (ideal for most spots)
