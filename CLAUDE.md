## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Flow

```
Browser Frontend (static/index.html)
    ↓ (HTTP REST)
Spring Boot Backend API (/api/v1/*)
    ├─→ /api/v1/spots (all spots with forecasts)
    ├─→ /api/v1/spots/{id} (single spot, triggers IFS fetch)
    ├─→ /api/v1/spots/{id}/{model} (single spot with GFS or IFS forecast)
    └─→ /api/v1/sponsors (sponsors and main sponsors)
    ↓
AggregatorService (core orchestrator with Java 24 StructuredTaskScope)
    ├─→ ForecastService → Windguru micro API (GFS & IFS models)
    ├─→ CurrentConditionsService → Multiple station providers (strategy pattern)
    ├─→ GoogleMapsService → Google Maps (URL resolver, embeds)
    └─→ AiService → LLM (OpenAI/Ollama via Spring AI ChatClient)
```

### Key Components

1. **AggregatorService** (`service/AggregatorService.java`)
   - Central orchestrator with multiple scheduled tasks:
     - Forecasts: every 3 hours (GFS model, daily + hourly)
     - Current conditions: every 1 minute
     - AI analysis: every 8 hours (if enabled)
   - Uses Java 24 StructuredTaskScope with virtual threads for concurrent execution
   - Semaphore-based rate limiting (32 forecasts, 32 conditions, 16 AI)
   - Maintains 6 in-memory caches (ConcurrentHashMap):
     - forecastCache: Map<Integer, ForecastData(daily, hourlyGfs, hourlyIfs)>
     - currentConditions: Map<Integer, CurrentConditions>
     - aiAnalysis: Map<Integer, String>
     - embeddedMaps: Map<Integer, String> (lazy-loaded)
     - hourlyForecastCacheTimestamps: Map<Integer, Long> (3h TTL)
     - spots: AtomicReference<List<Spot>> (loaded at startup)
   - On-demand IFS model fetching when single spot is accessed

2. **ForecastService** (`service/ForecastService.java`)
   - Fetches weather forecasts from Windguru micro API
   - Supports multiple forecast models:
     - GFS (Global Forecast System - NOAA)
     - IFS (Integrated Forecast System - ECMWF)
   - Parses text-based exports using regex patterns
   - Returns ForecastData with daily and hourly forecasts
   - Data includes: wind speed/gust, direction (deg + cardinal), temperature, precipitation

3. **CurrentConditionsService** (`service/CurrentConditionsService.java`)
   - Uses strategy pattern for different weather station providers
   - Providers: WiatrKadyny (Poland), Kiteriders (Austria)
   - Scrapes/parses real-time wind data from station websites
   - Filters empty conditions (not cached)
   - Returns current wind speed, gusts, direction, temperature, timestamp

4. **AiService** (`service/AiService.java`)
   - Optional feature (disabled by default via feature flag)
   - Generates AI-powered forecast summaries using Spring AI ChatClient
   - Supports two providers: OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) or Ollama (smollm2:135m)
   - Professional kitesurfing analyst prompt with kite size recommendations:
     - Below 8 kts: not rideable
     - 8-11 kts: foil only
     - 12-14 kts: large kite (12-17 m²)
     - 15-18 kts: medium kite (11-12 m²)
     - 19-25 kts: small kite (9-10 m²)
     - 28+ kts: very small kite (5-7 m²)
   - Streams responses with 15s timeout and 3 retries
   - Supports spot-specific LLM context via SpotInfo.llmComment

5. **GoogleMapsService** (`service/GoogleMapsService.java`)
   - Converts location URLs to embeddable Google Maps iframes
   - Unshortens goo.gl and maps.app.goo.gl URLs (max 5 redirects)
   - Extracts coordinates from @lat,lng format
   - Generates iframe HTML with satellite view (z=13&t=k)
   - Lazy-loaded on first spot access, then cached

6. **SpotsController** (`controller/SpotsController.java`)
   - REST API endpoints:
     - `GET /api/v1/spots` - all spots with cached data
     - `GET /api/v1/spots/{id}` - single spot (GFS, triggers async IFS fetch)
     - `GET /api/v1/spots/{id}/{model}` - single spot with model selection (gfs/ifs)
     - `GET /api/v1/health` - health check
   - Returns reactive types: `Flux<Spot>` and `Mono<Spot>`
   - Enriches spots with cached forecasts, conditions, AI analysis, maps

7. **SponsorsController** (`controller/SponsorsController.java`)
   - REST API endpoints:
     - `GET /api/v1/sponsors` - all sponsors
     - `GET /api/v1/sponsors/{id}` - single sponsor
     - `GET /api/v1/sponsors/main` - main sponsors only (isMain=true)
   - Loads from sponsors.json at startup

### Data Model

**Spot** (`model/Spot.java`)
```java

```

## Data Sources

### spots.json
- Location: `src/main/resources/spots.json`
- Contains ~74 kite spots worldwide (Poland, Austria, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Brazil, etc.)
- Each spot includes: location, URLs (Windguru, Windfinder, ICM, webcam), spot info (water type, best wind, hazards, season)
- Loaded on startup by `JsonSpotsDataProvider`

### External APIs
- **micro.windguru.cz**: Text-based forecast exports (parsed with regex)
- **wiatrkadyny.pl**: Polish wind stations (multiple locations)
- **kiteriders.at**: Austrian weather stations (Podersdorf)

## Development Practices

### Conventions
- Java 24 with preview features enabled
- Reactive programming with WebFlux (avoid blocking operations)
- In-memory caching (no database)
- Scheduled data fetching (every 3 hours for forecasts, every 1 minute for current conditions)
- Strategy pattern for extensible weather station providers

### Testing
- Unit tests use JUnit 5 + Truth assertions
- MockWebServer for HTTP mocking
- Test coverage for services, controllers, mappers, and strategies
- Test coverage should be at least 80%

## AI Analysis Feature (Experimental)

The AI forecast analysis is disabled by default because:
1. Limited value for this specific use case
2. Small local LLMs (like smollm) sometimes produce invalid outputs
3. Cost consideration: OpenAI gpt-4o-mini costs ~$0.01 per 74 spots (31k tokens)
4. Estimated monthly cost at 6-hour intervals: ~$1.20/month (reasonable but not essential)

## Important Notes for AI Assistants

1. **Reactive Code**: This project uses Spring WebFlux. Avoid blocking operations. Use `Mono`, `Flux`, and reactive operators. Exception: `.block()` is allowed within Java 24 StructuredTaskScope contexts.

2. **Java 24 StructuredTaskScope**: This project uses preview features for structured concurrency:
   - Virtual threads via `Thread.ofVirtual().factory()`
   - Scoped concurrent execution with automatic cleanup
   - Subtasks tracked within scopes (ShutdownOnFailure or default)
   - Semaphore-based rate limiting to control concurrent API calls

3. **No Database**: All data is cached in-memory using ConcurrentHashMap. State is not persisted between restarts. This is intentional for simplicity and performance.

4. **Multiple Forecast Models**:
   - GFS (default): Fetched every 3h for all spots
   - IFS: Lazy-loaded when single spot is accessed (cached for 3h)
   - ForecastData structure holds both models + daily forecasts

5. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Forecasts: 3-hour refresh cycle (scheduled)
   - Current conditions: 1-minute refresh cycle (scheduled)
   - AI analysis: 8-hour refresh cycle (if enabled)
   - Embedded maps: Lazy-loaded once, cached forever
   - IFS model: On-demand, 3-hour TTL per spot

6. **Immutable Data**: All models use Java records (immutable). To update, create new instances using `.withX()` methods or record constructors.

7. **External Dependencies**: Code relies on third-party APIs (Windguru, weather stations, Google Maps, LLMs). Network failures are expected and handled gracefully with timeouts, retries, and empty fallbacks.

8. **Scheduling**: Data fetching is automated via `@Scheduled` annotations with `@Async` execution. Multiple scheduled tasks run in parallel. Frontend shows cached data.

9. **Cardinal Direction Mapping**: `WeatherForecastMapper` converts degrees (0-360) to cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) with ±22.5° tolerance.

10. **AI Analysis**:
    - Disabled by default via feature flag
    - Streams content with Spring AI ChatClient
    - Supports spot-specific context via SpotInfo.llmComment
    - Professional kitesurfing analyst with kite size recommendations
    - 15s timeout, 3 retries, 1s delay between stream chunks

11. **Error Handling**: Uses `@Retryable` with exponential backoff, `@Recover` fallback methods, and reactive error operators (`onErrorResume`, `onErrorReturn`).

12. **Generated Frontend Assets**: Do not edit `.html`, `.css`, or `.js` files inside `src/main/java/resources`; they are minified outputs generated during the build process.
